Welcome to my Water Quality Satellite Repository — a space dedicated to sharing simple and practical workflows for monitoring and analyzing water quality using satellite data. The main goal of this repository is to help learners, researchers, and environmental practitioners understand how satellite-based water quality assessments are performed, step by step.

Each script is designed to be easy to follow with detailed explanations of what each line does and why it is used. I believe that truly learning remote sensing starts with understanding the logic and purpose behind every piece of code.

I sincerely acknowledge and appreciate all the experts, open-source developers, and researchers whose shared codes and materials have guided and inspired this project. This repository emphasizes learning through understanding, not just replication.
