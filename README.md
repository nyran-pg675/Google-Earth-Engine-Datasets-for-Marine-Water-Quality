Coral reef is an important marine ecosystem that offers ecological, economic, and social advantage. Yet, these ecosystems are under severe threat due to climate change, rising sea surface temperature, ocean acidification, and anthropogenic activities. The rise in sea surface temperature over the past few decades has led to a major increase in coral health issues. The commonly used indices for calculating thermal stress on coral reef using satellite SST data include the Bleaching Threshold (BT), Positive SST Anomaly (PA), and Degree Heating Week (DWH). Surface Temperature (SST) data derived from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) version 2 dataset are widely used to evaluate thermal stress anomalies and bleaching patterns over the period of 1982 to present. The NOAA OISST v2 is a high-resolution dataset that has a spatial resolution of 0.25° and a temporal resolution of one day. Water parameters and coral cover are strongly related, and river run-off (plume) can further influence water condition. As a result, the key parameters can be narrowed down to temperature, temperature anomalies and river plume.
